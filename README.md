# Music Player

Fooling around with a program I was given from CodeCore. Originally it only supported one octave. I expanded it to support 3 octaves.

To play a song written go into songs.js and uncomment the corresponding line of playSong(songname, tempo)

You can write your own if you want. ParseSong will take a string of notes. The number before the letter name denotes its octave, the letter after will determine it duration. If you do not specify a duration It will default to one.

This was fun to work on and could be expanded a lot. I think it would be cool to make a web based music station with JavaScript. I'd like it to support different instruments and have the ability to jam along with a backing track. Alas I do not have the time to pursue this project at this point.

If I were to expand I think I would rewrite the code from the ground up to support a more natural notation system.
